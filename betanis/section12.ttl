    Special populations
    Renal and hepatic impairment
    Betmiga has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and it is therefore not recommended for use in these patient populations.

    The following table provides the daily dosing recommendations for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment in the absence and presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors.
